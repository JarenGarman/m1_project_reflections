# M1 Interview Prep - Project Log

## First Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used

1. Ruby
2. RSpec
3. Pry
4. Rubocop
5. Google
6. StackOverflow
7. Ruby API (Ruby Docs)

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does

This project is a kind of trivia game that will ask the user questions, take their answers as input, and keep track of their score.

### Reflection Questions

**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**

I used a few enumerables in my project, specifically in my flashcard_runner I used `each` to iterate through my cards during the game.

**2. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**

My first step is to clarify what my problem is. I ask myself "What was the expected outcome? What did I want to happen?" This makes it a tad easier to take the next steps which are usually googling or referencing the Ruby API.

**3. What was your process when you got stuck?**

Take a pom, go outside or eat something, and come back with a fresh set of eyes.

**4. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**

I would take it slower and try to work at the pace of my cohort-mates so we could help each other through each step.

**5. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**

Reading documentation was my saving grace through this project. I learn best by seeing examples and the ruby docs in particular have a ton of examples that were really helpful with understanding what particular methods are doing.

**6. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**

I was able to see my project take shape before even writing any code. It was very helpful to have that outline of what it needed to do before writing the code.

## Second Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used

1. Ruby
2. RSpec
3. Pry
4. Rubocop
5. Ruby API (Ruby Docs)

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does

This project reads from external data sources to create various objects that can interact with each other.

### Reflection Questions

**1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**

My first step was to look through each lib file to get an idea of the different classes and methods we were given. My next step was to run the tests and examine any failures we got. Troubleshooting the existing codebase gave me a deeper understanding of the code we had available.

**2. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**

TDD helped me basically write the code within the tests. This way, when I go to write the actual code, I usually know exactly what to write because I've already pseudo-written it in the tests.

**3. What was a resource that you used during this project and how did you use this to move your project forward?**

I used the Study Hall basically every day both to help and to get help from my classmates and bounce ideas off of each other. This made it a really enjoyable experience and we all learned a lot throughout.
